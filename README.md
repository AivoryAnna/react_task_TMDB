# Agiledrop Task

A task where I had to create a list of movies with a genres filter.
For reference I took this website https://www.themoviedb.org/movie.
For necessary data I used the API from https://www.themoviedb.org/ and the documentation from here https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction.
